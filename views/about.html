               <p> <strong>Kimberly Dianne Shattuck</strong> (July 17, 1963 – October 2, 2019) was an American singer, musician, and songwriter. She was the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter of the American punk rock band <strong> the Muffs</strong>, which formed in 1991. From 1985 to 1990, Shattuck was a member of <strong>The Pandoras</strong> . In 2001, she was a singer, guitarist and songwriter for The Beards, a superpop side project composed of Shattuck, Lisa Marr, and Sherri Solinger</p>
               <p>Shattuck formed the Muffs in 1991 in Los Angeles. The band remained active over the following two decades, releasing six albums between 1993 and 2014.

                In addition to her work with the Muffs, Shattuck was involved in numerous other musical projects: She sang on a NOFX song, <strong>"Lori Meyers"</strong> on the album Punk in Drublic, as well as on a Bowling for Soup song, "I'll Always Remember You (That Way)", which was included with the single "My Wena". She also collaborated with vocals for the Kepi Ghoulie song "This Friend of Mine" on the album American Gothic and The Dollyrots for their track "Some Girls" off the album A Little Messed Up. Shattuck is the namesake of Dr. Shattuck, a character on Mr. Show (HBO, 1995–1999).
                
                Shattuck joined <strong>Pixies</strong> for their fall 2013 European tour, following the departure of original member Kim Deal. At the conclusion of the tour in late November 2013, she was fired by the band.
                
                Shattuck participated in a reunion of The Pandoras on July 4, 2015, at the Burger Boogaloo in Oakland, California. Although she played bass and sang backing vocals in The Pandoras, she was the lead singer and guitarist for the reunion due to the 1991 death of original Pandoras lead singer and guitarist Paula Pierce.</p>
                <p>Shattuck died at her home in Los Angeles on October 2, 2019, from complications of ALS, aged 56. She never publicly disclosed that she had the disease, but did state that it ran in her paternal family. Shattuck was survived by her mother and two siblings, as well as her husband of 16 years, Kevin Sutherland. Shortly before her death, the Muffs had recorded their seventh studio album, No Holiday, which was released on October 18, 2019.</p>
